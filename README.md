# GusFisher
A Unity/Vive recreation of the Gus Fisher gallery  

ALTER is a group exhibition that provokes questions about our
entagled relations between human and non-human, virtual and real.

This exhibition includes works by international contemporary artists who
critically address the posthuman. Referencing biomimetic self,
these works often draw on neurobiology, brain imagin,
neuropsychology, robotics and computational modeling. Each artwork is
a product of shifting collaborative process involving artists, computer
scientists, neuroscientists and medical practitioners.

Artists working in connection with technoscientific practices are
activating an exploration, an extension and an alternative to the physical
boundaries of the body. The artworks in this show oscillate between
character and computational representation while engaging in a dialogue
that challenges popular notions of self identity.
