# GusFisher
A Unity/Vive recreation of the Gus Fisher gallery  

The videos are not committed to this Git repository to stay within GitHub file size limits. These can be downloaded from https://seafile.cer.auckland.ac.nz/d/723b952059/ and should be placed in Assets\Custom\Textures\Exhibitions\Videos  
Additionally, Assets/Custom/Geo/Exhibitions/Logo/BabyX_Blurb.obj is not committed due to being oversize, this can be downloaded from the same seafile folder.
